# Project description

In this project we aim to work on image generation from textual descriptions. In particular, we want to generate a photo of the product (clothes) from online shop based on its textual description. The problem of creating an image for products in online shops arises from having only textual description of the product available, while it is desirable to have an image representation of the product to draw attention of buyers. Also, this project can have a great impact to the area of fashion, because generated images can be an inspiration for designers and manufacturers. 

Inspired by recent developments of diffusion models on text-to-image generation field, we use [Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4) as our main model. We will use fashion product images  [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paramaggarwal/fashion-product-images-dataset) for training the model.
